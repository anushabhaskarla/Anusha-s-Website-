    <h3>Long Island – Finding Your Anchor</h3>
    <p>“This looks just like home…” <br><br>

It’s an odd sense of déjà vu, ending up in a place that is completely new, yet so familiar. Life has its way of bringing you to new places that are so reminiscent of your past and it’s nice to know that no matter where you go, you’ll be able to find a sense of comfort.

Going on the first of what I hope to be many “adventures of a lifetime”, it was fascinating to be able to look around me and see elements of what I call home. New chapters in life can start at the most random times and can be as simple as waking up one random morning to things being different. Being miles away from home, traveling alone for the first time in my life, I couldn’t stop picking out things that reminded me of the place that I’m from.

Being in college is an odd thing. It’s almost as if you’re in a bubble; somehow sheltered, yet completely vulnerable at the same time. Every day is a new turn of life, and the people around you grow and change constantly. People move on to new things as each minute passes by and it can be disconcerting. What’s important to remember is that no matter how much things are changing around you, there’s a lot to remember about your past. Even the smallest memories can take away some of the discomfort that comes along with change. Whether it’s you that is going through something new, or that everybody else is changing around you, it’s nice to know that even though things are different, they might not be as different as you think they are.</p>
        
        <h3>Princeton University – And Now I’m Here (Again)</h3>
        <p>“I wonder what it’s like to go here…” <br><br>
        The journey of finding yourself is a journey that will never end. It is, in its own sense, an adventure. An adventure with an undercurrent of excitement coupled with the curiosity of not knowing what’s coming next. As we grow and change as individuals, we learn a lot about ourselves, yet it is hard to avoid thinking about former versions of ourselves.

Being on the campus of Princeton University put me in the shoes of High School Freshman Me. High school, especially mine, was a mystical place. I’ll never completely understand who I was during that time in my life, but I will always remember how it felt to be me in high school. I was a timid girl with high hopes and no idea how to achieve them. High school is an easy place to lose your sense of self. I used to be a girl that made others’ dreams her own because I didn’t know what I wanted. Often times, I was in over my head; I constantly compared my own achievements to people who, in my opinion back then, were better than me at everything. It’s quite difficult to find yourself in a place of fierce competition. You can’t grow the way you want to or be the person you wish to be. Your own dreams are always painted over by those of other people. I was often left thinking “if this person is better than me at everything, their dreams are probably better too”. Looking back a few years later I know how senseless that is.

Individuality is important. Doing what you want to do is imperative. Firsthand experience has shown me time and again that it doesn’t matter what choices other people make. If you hate what you’re doing every day, you’re not going to do well, plain and simple. 

Something that never fails to amaze me is how much two years can change a person. College for me was eye opening in so many amazing ways. Having the confidence to be myself is something priceless; lately, I’ve been able to tread more distance on the path of finding myself than ever before. My dreams are my dreams, nobody else’s. My goals are my goals because I want them. I’m doing things I love, and I’m doing them because I want to, not because everyone else is doing it too.

Standing on the grounds of one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, I realized how far I had come in the last six years. I am happy with my choices and proud of my achievements and that, I can live with.

        <h3>Chelsea Flea Market: Objects in Time</h3>
        <p>“I’ve always wanted a pocket watch…”<br><br>
       Time is fleeting, yet lasts forever. I have yet to come across another concept that presents itself with more intricacies and complexities than time. Something that often comes along with the exploration of time is perception. Something that is often forgotten when considering time is reality…

On a rickety table, early on a hot morning in Chelsea, there sits a silver pocket watch. The metal engraved with a complicated design. It lies safely within its glass case, protecting it from hands that are not meant to touch. Such an unassuming object, yet it is likely much older than I am. It has likely traveled more places than I have. In this moment, the pocket watch is something I wish to have. It means mystery, adventure, and endless possibilities; it’s a far stretch for just an object, but I have always had an endless imagination. Perhaps if I were to hold it, my life would be instilled with the same mystery and adventure that I see in this timepiece.

On June, 25th 2016 I laid my eyes on a beautiful pocket watch, yet I can’t help but wonder, just how many eyes have been laid on this tiny object? It must be tens, perhaps thousands. Those eyes belong to tens and thousands of different people. People who have different life stories. To each of these people, the moment that they laid their eyes on this pocket watch meant something completely different. From the first moment that this pocket watch was held by its original owner, to this moment today, its meaning and significance have undoubtedly changed an exponential number of times.

The world is different for all of us. The way I see things is going to be different than the way you see things, and this reality can be captivating and frustrating all at once. A group of people gathered around a single object can see one hundred different things, possibly even more. That same group of people gathered around the same single object ten years later might see two hundred more things.

As time carries on, the world changes, and along with it change the people that live on it. Our evolving perceptions will forever be a source of curiosity for me, and I can’t help but wonder what that pocket watch would mean to me on June 25th, 2026 if I were lucky enough to lay my eyes on it again.

        <h3>New York Public Library: The Hidden Gems of New York City</h3>
        <p>“We just read actual words that George Washington wrote. With his hands…”<br><br>
     I’m not surprised at all. Out of all the things I did in NYC, I’d have to say that visiting the New York Public Library is my clear favorite. My face shifted between two expressions: a smile of excitement and my mouth gaping in awe. History never fails to amaze me. So much has happened in the past to shape the world today. Learning about those events and learning from those events can be some of the most valuable lessons of life.

Walking into a building scattered with historical and literary gems at every turn was a more than pleasant surprise. Decoding George Washington’s handwriting and learning about Alexander Hamilton’s past straight from the letters he wrote was fascinating. I’m the kind of person who goes to a museum and reads every single word at exhibits, so being able to take my time and just absorb the information, energy, and history that was around me was a priceless experience.

I found myself laughing at the jealousy that was bubbling up inside me because actual New Yorkers have the chance to come here whenever they want. They can just bring their books and study in this giant historical landmark. That’s amazing. There are 10,477 collections of archives in the NYPL. Over 56.5 thousand feet of documents lie under the ground of Bryant Park in Manhattan. There is so much to see, so much to read and so much to learn from all these records. Perhaps next time, I’ll get the opportunity to explore a bit more.

          <h3>Times Square: Think Outside of Your Box</h3>
        <p>“There’s so many people here…”<br><br>
     “Think outside of the box” is a phrase that is, in my opinion, flawed. What exactly is “the box”? It sounds kind of frightening, in my opinion, and to many people it probably is. In this day and age, it doesn’t make sense to have one box. Everyone should have their own box because everyone’s limits are going to be different.

Any number of things can make your box different from mine. For example, my love for adventure and thrill makes jumping off a cliff very much inside my box. However, if you are afraid of heights, that notion is very much outside of your box. So far outside of it that you would likely think I’m insane for even suggesting it.

Many people in this world are archaic in believing that there is only one way. That only one thing is right. If this were true, we would have billions of people making erroneous choices on the hourly. Pushing yourself outside of your box might mean that you are trying to do something that all the people around you can already do well. What is often overlooked is that trying to learn things that you don’t know inherently means that somebody else in this world already knows them. If they didn’t, there would be nothing to learn and nobody to learn from. It is outside of your box, but not outside of theirs.

Every day, I grow a little more, learning exactly where the lines of my box lie. What are my limits, and what can I do to push them a little further with each experience I have. The box that limits me now is twice the size of the box that limited me four years ago. This box will continue to grow and shrink along with the changes in my life and the change I force upon it. And who knows? Four years down the road, it might not even be a box anymore.

        <h3>5th Avenue: All the Shiny Things that I Can Have… Someday</h3>
        <p>“Add this to the list of things we can’t do in New York City…[yet]”<br><br>
    When things seem out of reach it’s easy to give up and settle for the fact that it’s just not going to happen. I hate to admit it, but I used to do it way too often. Many people often avoid challenge instead of embracing it. Although that might bethe path of least resistance, it’s not going to be be the most fulfilling. Holding in your hands something that took your blood, sweat and tears to achieve is a feeling like no other. Pride, joy, satisfaction, elation… no matter how many of these words I use to attempt to describe it, there is really no way to explain it.

Every time I have that indescribable feeling, it only leaves me wanting more. Every time I work myself to the bone in order to achieve something, that feeling makes me want to do it all over again. It’s addicting, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to stop, nor do I want to.

Walking down the street on Fifth Avenue was an interesting experience. As every block passed me by, I found myself making lists of things that someday I want to have, not just wish to have. This doesn’t extend to just materialistic things like a purse or an outfit, but it means so much more. It means that I believe in myself to reach the place that I want to be, and that I’m not afraid to acknowledge the arduous journey that lies between myself and my dreams.

Fearing challenge is, in my opinion, a one-way street to limiting your potential. There is so much you can do to achieve what you want, and standing up to the challenges that await you will help you make your dreams reality. </p>
        
           <h3>Central Park: A Little Paradise</h3>
        <p>“You could build an entire town in this thing…” <br><br>
   Central Park amazes me. I still can’t wrap my head around its existence, and honestly, I know I will never be able to. 843 acres of grass, trees, water and serenity in the middle of the busiest city in the world seems impossible, but alas it exists.

In the middle of the largest city in the world is a place where people can smile, breathe, relax and maybe even walk a little slower. It goes to show that if New York City can have a safe haven, anyone can. As impossible as it seems, no matter how crazy things get, there is always an escape. It can be temporary and fleeting, but it is there, waiting for you.

Central park makes up just 1.3 of New York City’s sweeping 305 square miles. That is 0.043%; probably seems like nothing at all, but that is only until you go there. It’s only until you stand on the soil and appreciate the existence of things like grass and trees after getting lost in a concrete jungle for hours on end. For anyone who thinks Central Park is small, see how long it takes to walk from one end to another. You might change your mind.  

This 0.043% of New York City is a place to breathe. A place to sit on a bench and read a book. Watch tiny sailboats bob around a pond, Feel the stress of the day leave your shoulders. Close your eyes to remember that, if you need to, you can always get away from it all.

No matter how bad things get, from now on I will make sure that there is always, at the very least, 0.043% of my mind that can just sit back and calm down… because if New York City can do it, there’s nothing stopping me. </p>
        
        
            <h3>Penn Station: The End of a Journey</h3>
        <p>“The track number isn’t up yet and I don’t know which train to get on, I’m freaking out…”<br><br>
   It’s hard to accept, but doubt is one of my most common feelings. I read emails about 20 times before I send them. I check the train schedule 20 times even though I know it better the back of my hand. For some reason, I don’t trust myself to know something, even though I already know that I know it. Pretty confusing, right? Yeah, I don’t get it either.

Traveling alone is exhilarating and terrifying all at the same time. The thought of “I’m finally on my own” mixed with the thought of “suddenly, I’m all alone” can be cause for some serious confusion. You are having fun and getting to know bits and pieces of yourself with every experience you live through, yet it’s very hard to squash that tiny feeling of doubt that tries to ruin all the fun.

Traveling alone is a big learning curve. I always say that the first time I try to do something I’m a mess, but every time after that I know exactly what to do. The more you let yourself be alone and function independently, the more confidence you will have in the future. Dare to figure it out on your own, succeed, and have the courage to do it again.

New York City was a successful adventure, the first success of many.  From this trip, I learned a lot. I learned about myself, about a city, and most importantly a little about life. Now that I’ve done it once, I can confidently say that I’m ready to do it a hundred more times. So on that note: I’ll see you next time, New York City. <br><br></p>
