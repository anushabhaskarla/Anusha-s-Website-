        <h1>Dream it? Do it.</h1> 
        <p> That's my philosophy. Dreaming big and setting difficult goals is how I challange myself to reach new heights. My current "dream big" goal is to use my creativity and imagination to solve real-world problems and develop innovative solutions for people all over the world.<br><br>On the day to day, I fill my life with opportunities to learn more through self guided passion projects. Learning itself is one of my passions, and I constantly use it to enable my discoveries of the latest innovations in graphic design, user interface  and application development. Together, my education in business and personal exploration of design have given me insight into where desgin meets business. I hope to further my understanding of how those two entities can entwine seamlessly to deliver the highest quality experience to individuals in both their personal and professional lives. <br><br> Some of my current passion projects are related to interface design, web development, and design theory. While design has become a huge part of my life, I continue to engage in my long held passions. I constantly find opportunities to express myself through what is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful forms of art: dance. In additon, for years I have been using my blog as a platform to share my voice and opinoins with people in my network. Finally, I love both travel and photography, and have been lucky enough to be able put those two passions together with my travel photography media platform.</p>
