        <h1>Making Business History: A Lesson In Literature</h1>
     
     
<p>On a hot summer day in 1599, history was made. A history like no other; a day hundreds of thousands of people would look back at for centuries to come. Curious men and women from all over London stand crowded in a place for the first time ever. This very moment is the opening show of the renowned Globe Theater. <br><br>

William Shakespeare is arguably one of the most famous figures of classic literature. To me, Shakespeare represents two things that I find incredibly fascinating: literature and history. After I began to pursue a career in business, however, I have come to the most interesting conclusion. Shakespeare was not merely a genius playwright and infamous figure of history. Shakespeare was also a businessman. <br><br>

The Globe Theater, as a matter of fact, is an example of one of the most successful businesses in history. This business not only changed the world. It revolutionized the entertainment industry, making Shakespeare the most successful playwright of all time. The Globe Theater was a platform to sell products: the plays that we have all come to know and love, even centuries later. Forever into the future, the products that Shakespeare sold to his patrons will be renowned, respected and recreated. <br><br>

Shakespeare represents a successful businessman driven by creative vision and talent. As the face of the playing company Lord Chamberlain’s Men – essentially the company he was the CEO and creative director of – Shakespeare proved for centuries to come that accessing your creativity is an essential in finding success. Although it is out of question for the business figures of this world to drop what they are doing in order to run off and become playwrights, many of the most innovative and successful leaders of our professional environment constantly using creativity to drive their results. <br><br>

As an individual who constantly invests in my creative side, whether it is through dance, writing, or art, it is reassuring to understand how valuable these skills are. In business environments when technical knowledge often overshadows all other things, it is important to understand what creativity can do for us. Creativity drives critical thinking, problem-solving and collaborative diversity. Without the ability to access the side of your brain that has fewer rules and walls set up, you would never be able to travel outside comfortable and established thought. Creativity doesn’t mean being able to paint the next Mona Lisa, but instead is about allowing your brain to go to places where it’s never gone – whether that is the next Mona Lisa or simply just the solution to your business problem. <br><br>

People beginning to use the skill of “doing business” to propel their creativity from just a thought to a viable solution is something that will, in my opinion, revolutionize the way we do business. Stories like Shakespeare are what teach me that business is an open world that one can make what they want. The skills I acquire through my business experiences can be applied to any profession. No matter what a person does, business is an essential skill that can differentiate a person from becoming the world’s most famous playwright and just another writer. At the same time, creativity can differentiate a person from being an innovative business leader and just another developer. <br><br>

So, as the curtains draw for the first showing of Henry V at the Globe Theater, the world was able to witness the beginning of a business that changed the world. Looking back at this moment in history, I can only hope that I myself can do the same someday.
