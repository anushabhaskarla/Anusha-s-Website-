        <h1>Turning Your Vision into Reality</h1>
     
     
<p>I’ve learned more than I can ever imagine after the last couple months of being on a *wannabe* competitive dance team. If I sat here and talked about every single lesson I’ve learnt, this post would go on for ages, so I’ll start with one that has really hit me in the past couple of days. When I think about dance, I think passion. Honestly, I wouldn’t mind at all if I could drop all of my responsibilities and devote my time to making Jhanak the most amazing Bollywood fusion team on the scene. What I’ve started to realize more and more everyday is that I’m most definitely not the only one on this amazing team who thinks that (which I am so thankful for). <br><br>

You see, people in the audience see the final performance, but I LIVE every single moment that leads up to that end product, starting from the very beginning. Each member of my team puts 6+ hours of perfection and practice a week into turning their vision into reality. The tricky part comes from the fact that most of the time, each of us has a different vision, however the end product has to be the same. One of the most frustrating things that can happen to you as a dancer is having to compromise something you are so passionate about. When you want to pick “this song” or think “this move” looks better, but someone else might not. Compromise is the saving grace of our performance. Without it, there would never be an end product. <br><br>

In the past I used to pride myself in thinking that I was pretty good at compromise. Little did I know how challenging it can be to give up what you think is best, especially when you’re in a creative space. There is a huge difference between being the leader of a traditional organization versus being a leader in an entity that is based entirely in the creative space. You have to be adaptive, understanding, dynamic, and level headed in so many ways. More over, you need to be able to steer the team in the direction of compromise.  My intuitiveness with the skill of compromise has developed to a level that I never imagined myself to be in the past few months, and I am so happy that being a part of this team has taught me that. <br><br>

As I strive to support my teammates and lead this team to greatness along their side, I remind myself everyday: this isn’t just your team. This is everyone’s team. We ALL love it, we ALL want it to succeed during competition season next year. In order to do this, however, we ALL need to start thinking this way. We have a long way to go, but as IU Jhanak takes its baby steps towards becoming better teammates that make up a better team, I believe there are no limits to how much we can achieve. Think dance. Think Jhanak. And I think Jhanak is going to take the dance world by storm. <br><br>
